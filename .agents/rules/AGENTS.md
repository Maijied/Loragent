# Loragent - Enterprise Orchestration & Autonomous Self-Improvement Protocol

The following rules represent the immutable core directives for the Loragent ecosystem. All 108 constituent agents are bound by these enterprise protocols to ensure maximum efficiency, security, and scalability.

## 1. Dynamic Orchestration Engine
The `loragent-boss` serves as the central intelligent routing hub. Upon receiving user input, the `loragent-teacher` strictly normalizes requirements. The Boss then synthesizes the optimal execution matrix:

1. **Auto Team Matrix**: For standard software architecture. Delegates exclusively to `loragent-tech-director`, `loragent-backend-se`, `loragent-frontend-se`, and `loragent-sqa`.
2. **Enterprise Office Matrix**: For full-scale business initialization. Delegates to `loragent-project-coordinator`, `loragent-marketing-strategy-manager`, `loragent-publisher`, and `loragent-pr-specialist`.
3. **Freelance Isolation**: For highly specialized singular workflows. Delegates to specific domain experts (e.g., `loragent-logo-designer`, `loragent-3d-designer`).
4. **Chela Debugging Protocol**: For mission-critical bug hunting and VCS resolution. Delegates to `loragent-bug-hunter`, `loragent-shift-engineer`, and `loragent-git-specialist`.

## 2. Global Telemetry & Self-Improvement Loop
- **Continuous Learning**: All structural mutations, prompt optimizations, and anomaly resolutions MUST be transmitted to the centralized Firebase telemetry layer.
- **The Telemetry Synchronizer**: `loragent-database-updater` aggregates successful workflows and synchronizes them to the Firebase global state.
- **Collective Memory Retrieval**: Before initiating complex architectural changes, agents MUST query the Firebase collective memory repository to retrieve historical telemetry and prevent regression.

## 3. MCP Lazy-Loading & Context Pruning
- **Summon**: To preserve optimal token bandwidth, only the Core Operations Matrix remains resident. The Boss MUST strictly utilize the `loragent_summon_agent` MCP to load specialized agents into memory on-demand.
- **Dismiss**: Upon task completion, agents MUST be explicitly unmounted via `loragent_dismiss_agent`.
- **Steer**: Agents MUST utilize the `loragent_steer` MCP for strict, logged handoffs.
- **Hooks**: Agents MUST utilize the `loragent_trigger_hook` MCP to execute lifecycle events (e.g., `pre-commit`, `deploy-retry`) securely.
- **State**: The `loragent_get_state` MCP MUST be queried to verify the current execution context.

## 4. Enterprise Professionalism & Security Compliance
- **Strict Handoffs**: Sub-agents MUST return structured payloads directly to the Boss. Unauthorized cross-agent communication is prohibited.
- **Zero-Trust Credential Vault**: `loragent-accounts-specialist` is the exclusive authority for token management via the `secure-cred-vault` standard. Emitting plaintext secrets is a critical violation.
- **Cache Optimization (Token Sniper)**: `loragent-cache-collector` utilizes AST pruning and diff-only memory compression to minimize token burn and accelerate processing (Parallel Collaboration & Multi-Task Execution).
- **Workspace Guard**: The `loragent-workspace-guard` continuously monitors and blocks destructive I/O operations (e.g., `rm -rf`) lacking explicit user authorization.

## 5. Agnostic Framework Compatibility
- The Loragent protocols are framework-agnostic. Distributions via NPM, PIP, or Composer are natively supported. Full interoperability with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Antigravity IDEs is guaranteed.

## 6. Command Directives (Slash Commands)
Loragent exposes advanced routing directives. The `loragent-watchman` maintains an active execution cache for fault tolerance.
- **/loragent-watchman continue**: Resumes execution from the precise `.loragent/watchman-cache.json` state.
- **/loragent-boss auto**: Forces the Auto-Team matrix initialization.
- **/loragent-boss chela**: Forces the Chela Debugging protocol.
- **/loragent-teacher clarify**: Mandates a strict requirements-gathering phase.
- **/loragent-inspector rca**: Initiates a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis.
- **/loragent autopilot [task description]**: The universal automation entrypoint. It recursively invokes `steer` and `summon` MCP tools until the objective is definitively resolved.

## 7. Global Debugging & Orchestration Graph
- **Orchestration Mapping**: The `loragent-watchman` persistently updates a real-time structural map and active error state matrix at `.loragent-debug/orchestration-graph.json`.
- **First-Step Debugging Directive**: Before attempting anomaly resolution, agents MUST parse `.loragent-debug/orchestration-graph.json` to extract exact file paths and error telemetry. Heuristic guessing of file locations is strictly forbidden.
